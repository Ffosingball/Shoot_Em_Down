In this game I used Scene Trees structure to put in order all my entities. I used ECS (Entities Component System) to create and process all game entities. Also I divided 
code in two parts: one in CommonGameCode folder, code there can be reused in other for other games as well. And in coursework_2 folder code only realted to the Shoot Em Down
game. Also I tried to use good practice of c++ as using smart pointers, const, references when appropriate. 

This is a 2D game with top-down view, where you fly in your airplane, trying to evade bullets from enemies and firing
your own bullets to destroy enemies.
